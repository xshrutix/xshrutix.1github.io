                    <B>Hey Love!! I wish you a very very Happy Birthday to you. I wish I could be with you on your birthday, but sadly I am not that lucky this time to be with you on your special Occasion. I wish I will fortunate enough to celebrate your next
                    birthday with you.
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>What I feel for you is nothing close to what words can perfectly paint and something stronger than what distance can weaken. I love you more than love itself and right now, I miss you and wish every second will find me in your alms. Canâ€™t wait to see you again and give you the hugs you deserve.
                    <br>
                     
                    <br> I still remember the first day I saw you, I don'T Know it was love at first glance or what but I really found you attractive the moment I saw you. A boy in pink tshirt stole my heart, I know I know it will sound a little bit cheesy
                    to you but its true that time I was experincing all that bollywood things, love is in the air, violin in the background, butterflies and all kind of stuff. I honestly thought at that time is we never gonna meet again so it's useless
                    to think about you. And now You are most important part of my life.
                   <br>
                   
    
                    <br> I really praise each and every moment we have spent together, from random text on instargram to late night calls we have made a lot of memories together. Although it was not that easy, some times situations
                    were not so favourable for us and sometimes we had even decided to not contact eachother, but see even after all that hurdels we are still together.And I wish same for the future.
