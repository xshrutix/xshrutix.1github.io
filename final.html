  <h2> I Promise You </h2>
  I promise to always lift you up
  When you are feeling down.
  I promise to wipe your tears
  When you feel you need to cry.
  I promise to keep you smiling
  To show off that beautiful smile you have.
  I promise to be your strength
  Whenever you fall weak.
  I promise to be your voice
  When you can't find the words.
  I promise to be your eyes
  When you cannot see.
  I promise to be your ears
  When you cannot hear.
  I promise to always tell you what's real
  When you want to hear the truth.
  I promise to be your dream catcher
  To chase away your every fear.
  I promise to be your smile
  When you're frowning.
  I promise to always cheer you up
  When you are down and blue.
  I promise to give you faith
  When you are feeling insecure.
  I promise to keep you sturdy
  When you are feeling unsafe.
  I promise to listen
  When you need to talk.
  I promise to tell you no lies,
  Just what is true.
  I promise to always lend you my shoulder
  For when you need to cry.
  I promise to always hold you
  When you need someone.
  I promise to always care for you.
  Wherever you are, I promise to always be there.
  I promise to never hurt you and never break your heart.
  I can't promise you the world.
  I can't promise you the sky.
  I can't promise you that we will never fight.
  I can't promise you that I will never cry,
  But I can promise you that I will always be true to you,
  And baby, I promise that I will always love you more than anything
  With all my heart.
  No matter what happens or what we go through.
  I'll love you until the end of time!
  I'll be your guardian angel.
  That's my promise to you!
