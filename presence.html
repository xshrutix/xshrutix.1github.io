  Every time I gaze into your eyes.

  I could never ever leave you.
  Forever together, our love is true.
  
  Baby, I love you so.

  Our hearts beat as one
  As we gaze in love stronger than the sun.
  
  Baby, I love you so.
  Baby, you are my heart and soul.
  Our lives have been infinitely entwined.
  Our love is truly one of a kind.
  
  Baby, I love you so.
  Baby, you are my heart and soul.
  Forever together is what we'll be.
  Forever together, Baby, just you and me.</b>
